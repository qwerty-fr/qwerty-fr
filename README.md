## 💡 Philosophy overview

This layout is entirely compatible with the QWERTY layout. All the keys of the QWERTY layout are kept in the same location. This means that anyone using a QWERTY layout can type on the QWERTY-fr layout without even knowing that they are not typing on a QWERTY layout.

In order to type special characters with diacritics, there are a few simple rules to know. <kbd>AltGr</kbd> corresponds to <kbd>Option ⌥</kbd> on macOS, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd> on Windows (useful if you don't have the <kbd>AltGr</kbd> key):

| Diacritic                              | How to type it                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Grave accent <code>`</code>            | Press <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + corresponding letter (works for letters e, u, i, o and a).                   |
| Acute accent <code>´</code>            | Press <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + key left the corresponding letter (works for the letter e).                  |
| Circumflex <code>^</code>              | Press <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + key above the corresponding letter (works for letters e, y, u, i, o and a).  |
| Diaeresis <code>¨</code>               | Press <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + key below the corresponding letter (works for letters e, y, u, i, o and a). |
| Cedilla <code>¸</code>                 | Press <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + corresponding letter (works for the letter c).                               |
| Ligature <code>œ</code>/<code>æ</code> | Press <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + key right the corresponding letter (works for letters o and a).              |


**Note**: Unlike AZERTY, you can combine all the accentuated letters with <kbd>Shift ⇧</kbd> and <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>. So for example:
- <kbd>AltGr</kbd> <kbd>Shift ⇧</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> outputs `Ç`.
- <kbd>AltGr</kbd> <kbd>Shift ⇧</kbd> <kbd>W</kbd> outputs `É`.

These two letters are impossible to type with an AZERTY layout. But with QWERTY-fr they are easy to type!


**Note 2**: You can type a [non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space) by pressing <kbd>AltGr</kbd> <kbd>Space</kbd>. And a [narrow non-breaking space (fr)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espace_fine_ins%C3%A9cable) by pressing <kbd>AltGr</kbd> <kbd>Shift ⇧</kbd> <kbd>Space</kbd>.

## 📦 Installation

This keyboard layout is available Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Windows

Download the [QWERTY-fr layout](https://github.com/qwerty-fr/qwerty-fr/releases/latest), extract it, and run **setup.exe**.

### Mac

Download the [QWERTY-fr layout](https://github.com/qwerty-fr/qwerty-fr/releases/latest) and extract **qwerty-fr.bundle** to :
- `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` to install for all users.
- `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` for user-local installation.

You'll need to restart macOS before using it or otherwise you'll encounter bugs.

**Protip**: On Apple keyboards the right <kbd>Option ⌥</kbd> key is often hard to access. You can use [Karabiner-Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) to switch the right <kbd>Option ⌥</kbd> key with the right <kbd>Commmand ⌘</kbd> key. This makes it easier to type characters!

### Linux

#### Ubuntu / Debian

Download the [Linux DEB file](https://github.com/qwerty-fr/qwerty-fr/releases/latest) and install it.

**Note**: On Ubuntu and other GNOME-based distributions, you need to [disable the Compose key functionality](https://askubuntu.com/a/1028964) or typing characters with <kbd>AltGr</kbd> won't work at all.

Alternatively, you can download the [Linux ZIP file](https://github.com/qwerty-fr/qwerty-fr/releases/latest) that you can extract at the root of your filesystem.

#### Archlinux

There is a user package for this: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xkb-qwerty-fr/
Use your favorite AUR helper to install it. Or in the directory containing the `PKGBUILD` file, run `makepkg -si`.
