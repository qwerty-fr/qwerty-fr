      1) Finishing the installation

        To globally install the layout, you need to manually link the layout bundle (only once):
          sudo ln -sf '#{prefix}/qwerty-fr.bundle' '/Library/Keyboard Layouts/'

        If you only want to only install the layout for the current user, do the following instead:
          ln -sf '#{prefix}/qwerty-fr.bundle' '~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/'


      2) Restart your system (dead keys don't work properly before restarting).


      3) You can then enable the qwerty-fr layout by doing the following:
          a) Open "System Preferences" → "Keyboard" → "Input Source".
          b) Click on "+" → Search for "qwerty-fr" → Click on "Add".
          c) Click on the layout selection icon in the menu bar of macOS and choose "qwerty-fr"

  test do
    system "false"
  end
end
